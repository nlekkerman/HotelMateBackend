- ✅ Organize serializers by functional responsibility
- ✅ Maintain backwards compatibility during migration
- ✅ Improve developer experience and code discoverability
- ✅ Reduce file sizes and complexity

## 📊 Success Metrics
- All 196 endpoints remain functional
- Django server runs without errors
- All imports work correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Complete documentation

## 📦 Deliverables
1. Separated view modules (public_views.py, booking_views.py, staff_views.py)
2. Separated serializer modules (base, public, booking, staff)
3. Updated URL configurations
4. Test suites for verification
5. Documentation and migration guides
