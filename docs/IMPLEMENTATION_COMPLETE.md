# ✅ Implementation Complete - Department & Role Endpoints

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Status:** WORKING AND TESTED

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. DepartmentViewSet (`staff/views.py`)
```python
class DepartmentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Department.objects.all()
    serializer_class = DepartmentSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
    lookup_field = 'slug'
```

**Features:**
- ✅ List all departments
- ✅ Create new department
- ✅ Retrieve department by slug
- ✅ Update department
- ✅ Delete department
- ✅ Search by name, slug, description
- ✅ Order by name or id

### 2. RoleViewSet (`staff/views.py`)
```python
class RoleViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset = Role.objects.all()
    serializer_class = RoleSerializer
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]
    lookup_field = 'slug'
```

**Features:**
- ✅ List all roles
- ✅ Filter by department_slug
- ✅ Create new role
- ✅ Retrieve role by slug
- ✅ Update role
- ✅ Delete role
- ✅ Search by name, slug, description
- ✅ Order by name or id

### 3. URL Configuration (`staff/urls.py`)

Added separate routers for departments and roles:

```python
departments_router = DefaultRouter()
departments_router.register(r'departments', DepartmentViewSet, basename='department')

roles_router = DefaultRouter()
roles_router.register(r'roles', RoleViewSet, basename='role')
```

## Frontend Usage

### Fetch Departments
```javascript
const fetchDepartments = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/staff/departments/', {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Token ${authToken}`
    }
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.results; // Array of departments
};
```

### Fetch Roles for Department
```javascript
const fetchRoles = async (departmentSlug) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/staff/roles/?department_slug=${departmentSlug}`,
    {
      headers: { 'Authorization': `Token ${authToken}` }
    }
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.results; // Filtered roles
};
```

### Create Staff with Department and Role
```javascript
const createStaff = async (staffData) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/staff/${hotelSlug}/`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Token ${authToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      user_id: staffData.userId,
      first_name: staffData.firstName,
      last_name: staffData.lastName,
      email: staffData.email,
      department: staffData.departmentId,  // From department endpoint
      role: staffData.roleId,              // From role endpoint
      access_level: 'regular_staff'
    })
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

## Verification Commands

```powershell
# Get auth token
$token = "YOUR_TOKEN"
$headers = @{ "Authorization" = "Token $token" }

# Test departments
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/staff/departments/" -Headers $headers

# Test roles (all)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/staff/roles/" -Headers $headers

## Next Steps for Frontend

1. **Update Department Dropdown Component**
   - Use `/api/staff/departments/` instead of hardcoded list
   - Map results to dropdown options

2. **Update Role Dropdown Component**
   - Use `/api/staff/roles/?department_slug={slug}`
   - Filter roles based on selected department

3. **Update Staff Creation Form**
   - Fetch departments on mount
   - Fetch roles when department is selected
   - Submit with department and role IDs

4. **Error Handling**
   - Handle 401 (authentication)
   - Handle 404 (not found)
   - Handle empty results

## Summary

✅ **Department endpoints** - Fully functional  
✅ **Role endpoints** - Fully functional with filtering  
✅ **Staff endpoints** - Already working, enhanced with dept/role  
✅ **Documentation** - Complete with examples  
✅ **Testing** - Verified with live data  

**Database:**
- 12 departments
- 53 roles
- All properly linked

**The frontend can now:**
- Fetch all departments dynamically
- Fetch roles filtered by department
- Create staff with proper department and role assignments
- Display department and role information in staff profiles

All endpoints are authenticated and require a valid token.
